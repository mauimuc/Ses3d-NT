Ses3d-NT is a program for simulating the propagation of seismic waves in a
spherical section. The code is based on a spectral-element discretization
of the seismic wave equation. It has been developed for continental-scale full
seismic waveform tomography. It is, however, applicable to a wide range
of local- to continental-scale wave propagation problems.

Ses3d-NT is based upon an algorithm and implementation initially developed by
Andreas Fichtner with the objective to provide an easy to use but flexible
regular grid waveform solver. Ses3d-NT is an advancement and refactor of
Andreas Fichtnerâ€™s deliberately puristic ses3d providing an user friendly and
highly flexible framework for seismic wave propagation along with imaging
capabilities.
